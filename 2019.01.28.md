## Ideas

- There are 888,931,098 possible social security numbers. As of June 25, 2011, assignment of the future numbers is random, whereas previously we were expected to exhaust somewhat earlier. Now the expected exhaust time is roughly 2093... that is unless the majority of Americans were to request a new number, which (and I'm not suggesting subversion) Americans can in fact do. Now if it were to happen there would be a huge issue though because of the size of the social security administration, and it's dated technology. Ergo, if you wanted quicker social security reform... just convince a lot of people to change their number.
