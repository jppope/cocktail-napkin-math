## Ideas

* I noticed that there is a large "cognitive" dissonance between the number of  PhDs there are in the machine learning space, and how many PhDs that employers believe there are. It's projected that there are roughly 2000 CS PhDs graduating each year (similar for related disciplines - e.g. Statistics). Assuming various areas of study in C.S. plus persons looking for academic work... My guess would be that there are probably 1000 PhDs tops that could become part of our Machine Learning/ AI workforce... and yet somehow **employers think it reasonable to have a PhD as a requirement.** Asymmetries like this cause some quacky effects - so it's worth watching.

* Considering one's self a leader might be a mistake. Ask yourself if you are actually a leader or if you are just surrounded by inferior people instead of peers?

* There are only 199,235 people that are really "past the point of no return financially"... meaning they really can't spend enough to send them back to join the rest of us...Ultra-High Net Worth Individuals are defined by >$30M in liquid assets and two-thirds are "Self Made". The smallness of the group was the main surprise for me, but also thinking about the extreme difficulty in spending all of that money without a complete lack of responsibility (Brewsters Millions scenario)... surprisingly hard even as a thought experiment. 

* Bernie Madoff has been in the News this week a lot, so I thought I would take a peek at how much "White Collar" crime there actually is in the United States. I came to find out that "White Collar Crime" is almost entirely fraud (it does not include cyber crime), but the surprising aspect of it is that it mainly resides in places where we have our largest, (lets call them) "social contract issues": medical Fraud, education fraud, investment fraud. Apparently there is something that makes people particularly venerable in these areas. Its estimated that there will be roughly 5500 prosecutions (started at least) by the end of the year according to Syracuse University. Which assuming they were all to be convicted (doubtful) wouldn't even be a percentage point of the 2.3 million Americans are currently incarcerated.
