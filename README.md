## Ideas

- The amount of revenue that Police departments might lose to automated vehicles is non-trivial. As an example estimated annual fines & fees per citizen in Chicago is $97.07 (2013) or ~\$263M. If we were to pretend that 20% of those fees were automobile related, Chicago could lose out on \$50M dollars of revenue. It also begs the question if we should start working on changing the drinking age back to a reasonable number.

- United Airlines: Apple is the biggest customer at San Francisco airport, spending $150m a year, and with 50 business class seats a day to Shanghai alone. This is a non-trivial amount of money too. The major airlines aren't incredibly profitable... United tends to make ~2 Billion annually. Ridiculous thought, but if Apple ran their own route to Shanghai with a 747 they could probably even make money.... not that they need it.
