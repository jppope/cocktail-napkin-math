* The war in Afghanistan has taken the lives of 1,856 U.S. soldiers (KIA only) over the course of roughly 17 years (since 2001, from a population of roughly 2.7 million service members). Comparing this to roughly ~3,000 annual deaths from the general population of the same age for car accidents... (~37,000 total deaths, ~30 Million) ... It might actually be safer to be in a war than just living in the United States.
