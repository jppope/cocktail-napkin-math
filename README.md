## Ideas: 

* Uber is looking at buying either Bird or Lime for potentially 10 Billion+. [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-electric-scooter/) charges about ~$300 per scooter. At that cost you could buy over 30 Million scooters. So what the hell is uber paying for? Their technology resources far exceed Bird or Lime... and I severly doubt it's to clean up their accounting practices.

* Index funds are currently America's "no fail" investment. They represent 4.6 Trillion Dollars of invested money (I.E. 1/3 of the stock market). How can something provide consistent awesome returns with almost no risk? ...That is, if something seems to good to be true...

* Raising minimum wage might be a bad idea. It incentivizes owners to replace cashiers with a touch pad ordering system. Building that system costs ~\$30K-\$50K (to do it right) so the tipping point for ROI is right around the cost of 1-2 people @ $13-\$15 /hr. Fast-casual restaurants are a pretty big opportunity here.

### [(I got involved with an) Index Fund Discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a1miwu/the_father_of_index_funds_sounds_a_warning_on/)

Discussion on Reddit about index funds, and some of the current threats to the system of passive investing. I touched on this in the ideas section... but the thing that should be going through your head: Does there exist such a thing as a "No-Risk" investment?

### [Macallan 60 just set a new record with a $1.2 million dollar bottle of whisky](https://www.christies.com/features/5-minutes-with-a-1926-bottle-of-The-Macallan-whisky-9384-1.aspx)
