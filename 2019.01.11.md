## Ideas

- I'm wondering if the decline of hats is related to an increase in car use. The time periods seem to correlate. Which also makes me wonder if a rise in urban living will increase hat sales/ use.
- Next time a Doctor gives you a percentage ask them what the sample size is and if you can see the anonymized data. 99% probability that they are making it up, much like this probability. 

## The Top Ten

### [Are Coders Worth it?](https://aeon.co/essays/dad-s-company-made-burgers-mine-just-eats-them)

Aeon piece that fails to capture much of the nuance that comes with the information economy. I'm mainly posting it to repost [an interesting response](https://meltingasphalt.com/wealth-the-toxic-byproduct/), [a classic post](https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks), [a concept adjacent to](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/), and then eventually [my own response]. 

### [Fight Club Style Tweet about Corn](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1074810043495796736)

Do you think you know about corn? You don't. Welcome to Jack's American Agricultural solution. 

### [US Healthcare is expensive because it's expensive](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2019/us-health-care-spending-highest-among-developed-countries.html)

Johns Hopkins performed an incredibly deep study to figure out that US healthcare is expensive because we charge more (AND we get zero extra value for that money). In a related article, Vox shows that [Emergency rooms are basically stealing from people](https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/12/18/18134825/emergency-room-bills-health-care-costs-america) with the way that they charge people. 

### [Github's Privates](https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/)

The world has gotten weird with Microsoft driving innovation. Minor blip on the Microsoft/ Github radar but seems like it could be another in a series of Microsoft victories. Github makes private repos free for small teams. 

### [Education's Business Model](https://www.conradbastable.com/essays/the-uncharity-of-college-the-big-business-nobody-understands)

Great Data Journalism Piece about inferring "the education business model"

### [Stopping the Show with Drones](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-21/gatwick-airport-delays-drones-troops-deployed/10645708)

A little slow on getting this one up... It may not have been new but it was new to me... Apparently drones caused a major London Airport to completely shut down... in what could be one of the first "terrorist" (might be a slight exaggeration) use of drones. 

### [Observations About Power Laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9rvroo/most_of_what_you_read_on_the_internet_is_written/)

Reddit discussion about power laws and how it relates to modern consumable reading material. 

### [Should You Even Blog?](https://sparktoro.com/blog/can-you-still-blog-your-way-to-visibility-credibility/)

Data driven article without much depth (Sorry Rand). The Article shows that blogging is useful to people that its useful to... but with graphs. It is a nice macro view to help those of us that like writing whether or not we're wasting our time.

### [And They Said You'd Never Use Math After Highschool!](https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary/status/1082273172114862083)

Cocktail Napkin Math LOVES this tweet. You should too.

### [Electric Goes Mainstream When...](https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/motorcycles/future-vehicles/livewire.html)

Harley Davidson releases a crazy cool electric motorcycle. Remember when Elon open-sourced all of Tesla's patents... this is exactly what we were hoping for.
