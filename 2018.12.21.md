## Ideas

- A quick reminder for things like leases, liability waivers, etc, you can modify them so long as you keep the look and feel of the document and almost no one will re-read them if they issued the agreement. Photoshop is your friend. I find this particularly useful because the terms are typically non-negotiable and the issuer is effectively strong arming you without a proper red-lining option. Make sure to get a signed copy.
- The number of One Hit Wonders in the 80's compared to previous decades shows a stark difference between the 80's and other decades. The definition is quantitative too (Using multiple Billboard rankings). There were (7) in the 1950s, (28) in the 1960s, (31) in the 1970s, (125) in the 1980s, (54) in the 1990s, and (47) in the 2000s. The 80s had almost 2.5 times the number as the 90s. Obviously there are a ton of confounding factors, but given the contrast, I think its easy enough to say that there's something going on.
